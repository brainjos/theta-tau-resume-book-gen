# THETA TAU RHO BETA PLEDGE PROJECT 
## PART B: THETA TAU: "A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING FRATERNITY"

This resume book creation tool is intended for use by the Theta Tau Theta Gamma Chapter 
Corporate Sponsorship Committee. It's used in conjunction with a Google Form to compile
resume books for whatever companies the chapter has decided to submit to, based on events
that the chapter has worked on with these companies in the past.  

## Getting Started

The user should install the python library "pandas", a common data analysis library.
More information can be found [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/).  

### Google Forms

A Google Form is the best way to collect data and format it into a CSV file. The form
should be formatted as such:

- Applicant Name
  - Firstname Lastname
- Major
  - In this example, we've made each College of Engineering major its own radio checkbox option, with a field for an "Other" major. This allows for variation in how users input their majors (e.g. MechE vs. Mechanical Engineering vs. ME)
- Year
  - We elected to set the categories as "Freshman," "Sophomore," "Junior," "Senior," and "Graduate," but with some small modifications to the code, graduation year could be used as well.
- Companies Applicant is Applying to:
  - These companies will be determined by the Corporate Sponsorship Committee based on events held with them previously in the year, among other factors.
- Resume
  - The naming convention used here is firstname_lastname_resume.pdf which is very important.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
